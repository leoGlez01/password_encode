# New Encryption Algorithm
## pip install encryptedcode

This package is imported absolutely in your .py files, for example: 'from encryptedcode.encrypted_code import encode', and contains two functions, one for encoding called encode() and another for decoding called decode() using the new L0123 algorithm created by Ing Software Leandro Gonzalez Espinosa

## Info
EncryptedCode is a python library accessible to everyone that is under development where I use a new encryption algorithm created by me and named L0123.
